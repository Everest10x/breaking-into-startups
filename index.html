											<h2>Part 1: Motivation </h2>
											<p>Before you begin taking tutorials, we believe you need to understand what it is like being an engineer. What does this title entail. How do you go about learning to become one.</p>

											<h2>Part 2: Self-Learning </h2>
											<p>There are a lot of tutorials for beginners that attempt to teach you the fundamentals, however, a lot of the time you walk away learning a subset of the language or technology, without grasping the full picture of the skillset required to build a functioning website. The resources below provide a comprehensive end-to-end experience.</p>

											<h2>Part 3: Applying to Bootcamps (Pre-work)</h2>
											<p>Whether or not you actually want to apply to a bootcamp, using the curriculum and tutorials laid out by some of the best coding schools will help take your coding skills to the next level. The emphasis is on the language syntax (JavaScript or Ruby) and will test your working knowledge of the language and how you can apply it to do basic computations.</p>

											<h2>Part 4: Common Pitfalls</h2>
											<p>Knowing what we know today, this is the advice we would of given ourselves when we were starting out.</p>
										</header>
										<div class="rec-list">
											<ul>
												<h4>Not finishing a tutorial:</h4>											
												<li>
													Most people don’t realize that a lot of beginners have to take the same tutorial 2-3 times before these concepts start to sink. 
												</li>
												<li>
													The first time you are just following the steps. The second time you are able to recognize patterns. The third time is when you actually understand how you would apply it.
												</li>
												<h4>Running into obstacles:</h4>											
												<li>
												Bugs and errors are frustrating, especially if you are just starting out.
												</li>
												<li>
													Most people don’t realize that 75% of the engineering time is spent debugging the code by googling errors or asking for help on Stack Overflow. To succeed you have to embrace the struggle and count that time spent as your learning experience.
												</li>
												<h4>Don’t be afraid of the unknown:</h4>											
												<li>
													No one start out knowing how to program, it’s a process that takes years to perfect. 
												</li>
												<li>
													Great engineers look forward to solving challenging problems they haven’t encountered before. 
												</li>
												<li>
													If nothing else, this mindset will keep you moving forward until one day you will look back at those problems and laugh how easy they were.
												</li>

											<h2>Part 5: Endgame</h2>
											<p>Once you have acquired the fundamentals of web development, this is some of the ways how you can apply your newly acquired skills.</p>
										</header>
										<div class="rec-list">
											<h3>Opportunities:</h3>
											<ul>
												<li><h4>Become a Software Engineer</h4>
													<ul>
														<li>
															Join a startup as an engineer in order to continue learning and advancing your skillset. Working on an engineering team will expose you to numerous experienced engineers, production code and industry best practices.
														</li>
														<li>
															Get paid to learn. Average engineering salary for a bootcamp graduate is over six figures.
														</li>
														<li>
															Join a mission driven startups. Not only will you be helping execute on the mission, you will also get equity to participate in the upside.
														</li>
													</ul>
